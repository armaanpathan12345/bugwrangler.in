# Well, It is not the END \#Passbrains

Dears,

As some of you already know, today is my last working day at PASS Technologies \(Passbrains\).

Yes, I am moving out of the company, The journey in these last 20 months has been the most amazing, fulfilling, educating and above all the â€˜most cherishedâ€™ one. I feel extremely privileged having gotten the opportunity to know and work with so many talented individuals from diverse backgrounds who are so welcoming and friendly. It has truly been an â€˜enriching life experienceâ€™ for me, Thank you one & all.

On a personal note, working in PASS was the best challenge of my life till date and I always tried to deliver my best. I always felt a sense of ownership and responsibility towards designing new era of crowd security testing. Today I am happy to say that I was part of history starting from scratch to one of the biggest crowd testing SaaS platform.

I especially want to thank **Dieter** for showing confidence & trust in my skills. **Mayank** who always guided me during my tenure & left an incredible impression on me over the years and I hope to carry the traits that I have gathered from you moving forward. A very special thanks to Passbrains Platform Leadership team, especially **Johannes, Vladan, Cris** and lately **Pari**. Your leadership and ability to get things done are an inspiration to me. Thanks for having faith in me and for motivating me to grow my career strengths. I have to say that in the passbrains team everyone pitches in, and work together in perfect harmony.

Thanks Passbrains Platforms Dev Team, PMs, Cerner , Automation , HR â€“ Operation team for being with me to create a great working atmosphere and for yielding unforgettable memories.Though I am leaving with a heavy heart, I am happy to leave for a good reason. Do give me a ring anytime you feel like. My contact number and email address will remain the same.
